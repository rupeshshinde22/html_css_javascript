                <p> Sri Lanka Crisis Live: The Sri Lankan Parliament Wednesday voted interim president Ranil
                    Wickremesinghe as the next President of the crisis-hit country. He won 134 of the total 219 votes
                    that were found valid. The other candidates in fray were ruling-party lawmaker Dullas Alahapperuma,
                    and leader of the leftist Janatha Vimukti Peramuna party Anura Kumara Dissanayaka.

                    Wickremesinghe was backed by a section of the ruling party that had a total of 145 seats as of the
                    last parliamentary election in 2020. Alahapperuma has the support of the other section as well as
                    the main opposition party that won 54 seats last time round, reported Reuters.

                    Meanwhile, the Indian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay said that India will help Sri
                    Lanka to make an “early and effective” economic recovery. To that effect, India, which has helped
                    Sri Lanka with almost $4 billion in aid would, “going forward,” like to bring in “more investment”
                    to help the country build capacities to respond to the economic challenges, Baglay said.

                    Parliament Monsoon Session 2022 Live Updates: The House was adjourned today and will resume
                    functions tomorrow at 11 am. After resuming at 4 pm, the Opposition continued shouting slogans to
                    protest against GST rates.

                    Soon after proceedings resumed in the Lok Sabha at 2 pm, Opposition members again carried posters of
                    ‘Gabbar Singh strikes again’ into the Well of the House to protest against the GST rates. Following
                    this, the Lower House was adjourned till 4 pm. The Rajya Sabha, meanwhile, has adjourned till 11 am
                    on July 21, amid Opposition protest.

                    Several Opposition MPs, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, staged a protest at the Gandhi
                    statue in the Parliament complex carrying packets of milk, curd, and other food items. Hitting out
                    at Gandhi, Union Minister Smriti Irani said, “His political life has been spent disrespecting
                    parliamentary traditions. Now he is dedicating himself to ensuring that parliamentary proceedings
                    and debates do not take place.” She added, “He may be unproductive politically but he should not
                    dare to continuously curb Parliament’s productivity.”

                    Meanwhile, sprinter P T Usha took the oath in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. She was nominated to the
                    Upper House last week.
